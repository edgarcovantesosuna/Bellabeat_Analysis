Among the files included, there is a PDF containing the information related to the case study, the history and background.\n\nTwo solutions presented in a Python and R Jupiter Notebooks (feel free to run them using Kaggle). Finally, a folder called `reports` where all the final reports are stored.\n\n## Scenario\n\nThe scenario is based on a company called Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The **hypothesis** is that the cofounder and Chief Creative Officer believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.\n\nTo do this, you have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Among the data collected you can find data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to gain knowledge about their own health and habits.\n\nThe **goal** is analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, provide high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. And to achieve such goal the cofounder and Chief Creative Officer asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then she wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation.\n\nThese are the research questions that will guide the analysis:\n\n1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n## Obtaining the data set\n\nBased on the case study definition, we make use of the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) available in Kaggle. This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.\n\nAlso, as part of the problem definition, it is recommended to consider adding another data to help address some limitations the data set may have.\n\n## Loading libraries\n\nNext we define a few libraries what we will need through the whole project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Collection of R libraries designed for data science\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Package used to manage conflicts (manage ambiguity with packages)\nlibrary(conflicted)\n\n# Package for declaratively creating graphics\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Package used to provide cross-platform interface to file system operations\nlibrary(fs)\n\n# Extends 'ggplot2' by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data.\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# A graphical display of a correlation matrix using ggplot2\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\n\n# Provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# Provides a number of user-level functions to work with \"grid\" graphics\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# Declaring filter and lag from the package dplyr as default choices\nconflict_prefer(\"filter\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"lag\", \"dplyr\")","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-18T01:03:47.771516Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-18T01:03:47.774621Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-18T01:03:50.660441Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading data-sets\n\nBefore we start working on the downloaded data-sets, let us first detailed how the data set is structured:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dir_tree(path = \"../input\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-18T01:04:13.517457Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-18T01:04:13.560265Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-18T01:04:13.707444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data set is defined by two sub folders, the first sub folder called `mturkfitbit_export_3.12.16-4.11.16` contains another sub folder called `Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16` which in turn contains 11 CSV files.

`dailyActivity_merged` we can go from 18 files to 9 files. And we can go even further since the file `minuteIntensitiesWide_merged`, is a wider version (with repeated information) of the file `minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged`. So by not considering `minuteIntensitiesWide_merged` in our analysis we end up with 8 files to analyze.\n\nAlso we are going to ignore the files named `weightLogInfo_merged` and `weightLogInfo_merged` since they do not provide information related to the how consumers are using smart devices. Those files seems to contain control data about the weight, BMI, Fat of each Id.\n\n**NOTE:** During a preliminary analysis we found that for the record `Id=1503960366` in `dailyActivity_merged` from `Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16` has `Calories=1985` but the calories reported in `hourlyCalories_merged` is `1988`, another discrepancy found was with `dailyActivity_merged$TotalSteps=13162` and `hourlySteps_merged$StepTotal=13158`. Based on what is written in the data set definition *Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preferences.* So we are going to ignore this differences.\n\n## Transforming and cleaning the data set\n\nBased on the observations/comments done previously, these are the selected files for our analysis:\n\n| `Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16` | `Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16` |\n|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|\n| `dailyActivity_merged`          | `dailyActivity_merged`          |\n| `heartrate_seconds_merged`      | `heartrate_seconds_merged`      |\n| `hourlyIntensities_merged`      | `hourlyIntensities_merged`      |\n| `minuteMETsNarrow_merged`       | `minuteMETsNarrow_merged`       |\n| `minuteSleep_merged`            | `minuteSleep_merged`            |\n|                                 | `sleepDay_merged`               |\n\nWe are going to start merging the corresponding files for `Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16` and `Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16`.

And if we check `TotalMinutesAsleep` vs `TotalTimeInBed` we observe correlation coefficient of 0.9, which indicates a significant and strong correlation between these two variables.\n\nFrom the previous results it seems that there is a strong positive correlation between the variables, `TotalSteps`, `TotalDistance`, `TrackerDistance`, `VeryActiveDistance`, `ModeratelyActiveDistance`, `LightActiveDistance`, `VeryActiveMinutes`, `LightlyActiveMinutes`, `Calories`, `TotalIntensity` and `METs`, this makes sense since more steps imply being more active distance and minutes invested, and the more active is the person, the more calories it burns.\n\nWe can also see this behavior in a different way with a negative correlation with respect to `SedentaryMinutes` vs `TotalSteps`, `TotalDistance`, `TrackerDistance`, `ModeratelyActiveDistance`, `LightActiveDistance`, `VeryActiveMinutes`, and `LightlyActiveMinutes`.

That data set only contained observations of a reduced number of users and it seems that does not share connections with other variables aside from the ones in the same data set like `TotalTimeInBed`, `TotalMinutesAsleep` and `MinuteSleep`.\n\nBut according to the correlations coefficients it seems to be a negative correlation between `MinuteSleep` and the variables `VeryActiveDistance`, `VeryActiveMinutes`, `SedentaryMinutes` and `Calories`, which indicates that the less sleeping time, the more active the person is, is may be an indicator that people prefer doing more time doing exercise than going to sleep. Then, at what time the more active people is going to sleep? And the more sedentary people are going to sleep less, why?

How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\nThe previous trends can be useful to monitor carefully the measurement of experiments, for example, we can observe that the participation for the sleep experiments is insignificant, since we do not have enough participation, these values were considered as not correlated with other variables. So it would be necessary to pay more attention and increase the participation.\n\nWith that in mind, Bellabeat should encourage people to be more active by providing some kind of rewards to those who agree to participate or reaches a certain milestone, such as achieving a certain number of steps, minimum minutes with very active distance and minutes, achieving a certain number of sleeping minutes.\n\n### 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nBy creating a marketing strategy that promotes the people's participation, but also convert those participants from light active distance and fair active minutes to more active categories. Also, try to suggest some home activities to try to reduce the percentage of sedentary minutes. \n\n### Future explorations\n\nSo for future explorations we would like to check on a weekly basis, which days of the week and when people is more active to try to understand what is the time period in which people is more/less active.
