by Edgar Covantes Osuna.

## Content

This repository contains two solutions for the Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study, as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

The task titled "Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?" consists of analyzing a case similar to what you might be asked for in a job interview.

The current repository contains several files and one folder used in the present analysis. Among the files included, there is a PDF containing the information related to the case study, the history and background. 

Two solutions presented in a Python and R Jupiter Notebooks (feel free to run them using Kaggle). Finally, a folder called `reports` where all the final reports are stored.

## Scenario

The scenario is based on a company called Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The **hypothesis** is that the cofounder and Chief Creative Officer believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

To do this, you have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. Among the data collected you can find data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to gain knowledge about their own health and habits.

The **goal** is analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, provide high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. And to achieve such goal the cofounder and Chief Creative Officer asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then she wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation.

These are the research questions that will guide the analysis:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
   
## Obtaining the data set

Based on the case study definition, we make use of the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) available in Kaggle. This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.

Also, as part of the problem definition, it is recommended to consider adding another data to help address some limitations the data set may have.
